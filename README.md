#*Week 2 Exercise Repository*
Welcome to the Week 2 Exercise Repository! This collection of files is part of my coursework, where I delved into both Java-based web development and PL/SQL scripting. The repository is divided into two main sections: a Maven-based Library Management System and a series of PL/SQL scripts.

Library Management System Projects
In this repository, you'll find two versions of a Library Management System project. Both versions are developed using Java, but each version reflects different stages of the project, showcasing the evolution of the system.

The more recent version, found in the LibraryManagement 9 folder, is built using Spring Boot, a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications. This project manages the basic operations of a library, such as adding new books, retrieving book information, updating details, and removing books. The structure includes a variety of Java files organized into controllers, services, and repositories. Additionally, it utilizes Maven for dependency management, ensuring that all necessary libraries are included and up-to-date. If you're familiar with Java and Spring Boot, this project should be straightforward to understand and run.

The earlier version of the project, located in the LibraryManagement-8 folder, has a similar purpose but a slightly different structure and implementation. This version might be interesting if you're curious to see how the project has progressed and refined over time.

PL/SQL Scripts
The second part of this repository is a collection of PL/SQL scripts. These scripts are designed to perform various database operations, demonstrating control structures, cursor handling, error management, and more. They also include practical examples such as stored procedures, triggers, and functions, which are essential for managing and manipulating data within a database. For anyone working with Oracle databases or interested in learning PL/SQL, these scripts provide a valuable resource.

In addition to the scripts, thereâ€™s a document (Week 2_PLSQL.docx) that provides further explanations and context, making it easier to understand the purpose and usage of each script.
